This App contains 14 turtle figures and these figures can be decided into 5 parts.

The first part is tree figures. “Tree” and “Tree 4” are basically done in the lab of CS6102 and “Tree 4” constructs a quad tree with 4 similar branches symmetrically positioned. In addition, “Tree 6” constructs a quad tree with 6 similar branches symmetrically positioned.

The second part is fern figures.”Fern” constructs a fern with 3 branches angled with 45, 30, 10 degree. “Fern with leaves” constructs a fern with leaves which are made up of arcs.

The third part is gasket figures.
Function gasket is to draw the sierpinsky gasket on equilateral triangle.
Function gasketRectangle is to draw the sierpinsky gasket on equilateral rectangle.
Function gasketHexagon is to draw the sierpinsky gasket on equilateral hexagon.
Function gasketCircle is to draw the sierpinsky gasket on circle (4 circles nesting).
Function gasketCircle2 is to draw the sierpinsky gasket on circle (6 circles nesting).

The fourth part is flake figures.
Function flake is the loop of function koch to form a flake shape.
Function flake2 is the loop of function koch to form a square flake shape.

The fifth part is Sierpinski figures.
The function Sierpinski is to draw a Sierpinski Curve which looks like a square.
The function Sierpinski2 is to draw a similar figure which looks like a Hexagon.

I have also made a cascade menu for the figure selection in the UI. The figures are divided into five classifications and you can chose any one to draw in this menu by clicking the specific selection.

In addition, after drawing the figure, the information about this figure will be shown underneath in the Turtle Interface window.
